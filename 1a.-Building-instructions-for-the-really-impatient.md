To get started with [Quantum++](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp), first
install the [Eigen 3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) library into your home directory, 
as `$HOME/eigen`. I implicitly assume that you use a UNIX-like system, although
everything should translate into Windows as well, with slight
modifications. You can change the name of the directory, but in the
current document I will use `$HOME/eigen` as the location of the
[Eigen 3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) library. Next, download or clone
[Quantum++](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp) library into the home
directory as `$HOME/qpp`. Finally, make sure that your compiler supports
C++11 and preferably [OpenMP](http://openmp.org/). As a compiler I
recommend [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/) version 5.0 or later or
[clang](http://clang.llvm.org) version 3.7 or later (previous versions
of [clang](http://clang.llvm.org) do not support
[OpenMP](http://openmp.org/)). You are now ready to go!

Next, we will build a simple minimal example to test that the installation was
successful. Create a directory called `$HOME/testing`, and inside it
create the file `minimal.cpp`, available for download in 
[`qpp/examples/minimal.cpp`](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp/blob/master/examples/minimal.cpp) and with 
the content listed below.

```CPP
// Minimal example
// Source: ./examples/minimal.cpp
#include <iostream>

#include "qpp.h"

int main() {
    using namespace qpp;
    std::cout << "Hello Quantum++!\nThis is the |0> state:\n";
    std::cout << disp(st.z0) << '\n';
}
```

Next, compile the file using the C++11 compliant compiler. In the
following I assume you use [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/), but the building
instructions are similar for other compilers. From the directory
`$HOME/testing` type

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -isystem $HOME/eigen -I $HOME/qpp/include minimal.cpp -o minimal
```

Your compile command may differ from the above, depending on the C++
compiler and operating system. If everything went fine, the above
command should build an executable `minimal` in `$HOME/testing`, which
can be run by typing `./minimal`. The output should be similar to the
following:

```text
Hello Quantum++!
This is the |0> state:
1
0
````

The line

```CPP
#include "qpp.h"
```

includes the main header file of the
library `qpp.h` This header file includes all other necessary internal
[Quantum++](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp) header files. The line
```CPP
using namespace qpp;
```
injects the [Quantum++](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp)'s namespace into
the working namespace, so we don't need to prefix the library functions by
`qpp::`. Finally the line 

```CPP
std::cout << disp(st.z0) << '\n';
```

displays the state |0> represented by the singleton `qpp::st.z0` in a
nice format using the display manipulator `qpp::disp()`.
