About
========
[Quantum++](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp) is a modern general-purpose multi-threaded
quantum computing library written in C++11 and composed solely of header
files. The library is not restricted to qubit systems or specific
quantum information processing tasks, being capable of simulating
arbitrary quantum processes. The main design factors taken in
consideration were the ease of use, portability, and performance. The
libraryâ€™s simulation capabilities are only restricted by the amount of
available physical memory. On a typical machine (Intel i5 8Gb RAM)
Quantum++ can successfully simulate the evolution of 25 qubits in a pure
state or of 12 qubits in a mixed state reasonably fast.
