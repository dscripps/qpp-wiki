## Via [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com)

- [Quantum++](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp) contains a full [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com) 
solution under the folder [`./VisualStudio`](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp/tree/master/VisualStudio). 
The solution 
expects [Eigen 3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) to be installed 
under `C:\eigen`. Use this solution at first to get you started. 
A unit testing project (`qpp_testing`) with 
[Google Test 1.8.0](https://github.com/google/googletest) is also 
included in the solution.

-  [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com) versions preceding 
version 2015 do not have full C++11 support. If you decide to use 
[Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com) make sure you install version
2015 or later. I recommend using 
[Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com).
    
- [Visual Studio 2015/2017](https://www.visualstudio.com) only
supports [OpenMP 2.0](http://openmp.org/). 
[Quantum++](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp) uses features
from [OpenMP 3.0](http://openmp.org/), hence 
[Quantum++](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp) will not compile
on [Visual Studio 2015/2017](https://www.visualstudio.com) if you 
`#define WITH_OPENMP_` in your source file and enable 
[OpenMP](http://openmp.org/) (disabled by default) in
    
    *Project/Properties/Configuration Properties/C_C++/Language/Open MP Support*
.
    
## Via [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com)

- Use the [same building instructions](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp/wiki/Building-instructions-for-POSIX-compliant-platforms) as for POSIX systems.
- **Note:** some earlier versions of 
[Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com) had a bug related to lack of support for some 
C++11 math functions, see
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28997206/cygwin-support-for-c11-in-g4-9-2>
for more details. Quick fix: patch the standard library header file `<cmath>` 
using the provided patch `./cmath_cygwin.patch`. Later 
[Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com) versions seem to have fixed the issue (as of Nov. 2016).
