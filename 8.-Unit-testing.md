[Quantum++](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp) 
was extensively tested under multiple flavours of Linux,
[OS X/macOS](http://www.apple.com/osx), 
[Windows XP/7/10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows),
[Solaris 11.x](https://www.oracle.com/solaris/solaris11/index.html)
via a suite of unit tests constructed with
[Google Test 1.8.0](https://github.com/google/googletest) (included with the 
project in `./unit_tests/lib/gtest-1.8.0`). The source code of the unit tests 
is provided under `./unit_tests/tests`. 

To build and run the unit tests under any POSIX-compliant platform, I 
strongly recommend to use [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) version 3.0 or 
later. Assuming you do use [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/), switch to the  
`./unit_tests` directory, create a `build` directory inside it, then from the 
newly created `./unit_tests/build` type

    cmake ..
    make
    
The commands above build `./unit_tests/build/tests/qpp_testing`, which you 
then may run. Note that `qpp::Timer` tests or tests related to random functions
such as `qpp::rand()` may sometime (very rarely) fail, due to timing 
imprecision or statistical errors. Such behaviour is perfectly normal.

To run the unit tests in [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows) under
[Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com), use the provided solution and 
run the `qpp_testing` project from the Solution Explorer.

## Note

The [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) configuration file 
[`./unit_tests/CMakeLists.txt`](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp/blob/master/unit_tests/CMakeLists.txt) 
defines almost the same building options and default 
choices as the main 
[`CMakeLists.txt`](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt) 
of [Quantum++](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp). 
Therefore you should modify 
[`./unit_tests/CMakeLists.txt`](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp/blob/master/unit_tests/CMakeLists.txt) 
accordingly in case your [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) include/library files are in a different location than the one assumed in the file, or if you want to further customize the unit testing build.
