## About
[Quantum++](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp) is a C++11 general purpose quantum
computing library, composed solely of header files. [Quantum++](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp) is written in standard C++11 and has very low external dependencies. It only uses the
[Eigen 3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) linear algebra library and, if
available, the [OpenMP](http://openmp.org/) multi-processing library.
For additional [Eigen 3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) documentation please

For a simple [Eigen 3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) quick ASCII reference
please click [here](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/AsciiQuickReference.txt).

[Quantum++](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp) is not restricted to qubit systems or specific quantum 
information processing tasks, being capable of simulating arbitrary quantum 
processes. The main design factors taken in consideration were the ease of 
use, high portability, and high performance. The library's simulation
capabilities are only restricted by the amount of available physical memory. 
On a typical machine (Intel i5 8Gb RAM) [Quantum++](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp) can successfully simulate 
the evolution of 25 qubits in a pure state or of 12 qubits in a mixed state 
reasonably fast.

The simulator defines a large collection of (template) quantum computing
related functions and a few useful classes. The main data types are
complex vectors and complex matrices, which I will describe below. Most
functions operate on such vectors/matrices and *always* return the
result by value. Collection of objects are implemented via the standard
library container [`std::vector<>`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector), 
instantiated accordingly.

Although there are many available quantum computing libraries/simulators
written in various programming languages, see e.g.
[Quantiki's list of QC simulators](http://www.quantiki.org/wiki/List_of_QC_simulators) 
for a comprehensive list, I hope that what makes
[Quantum++](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp) different is the ease of
use, portability and high performance. 
I have chosen the C++ programming language (standard C++11) for
implementing the library as it is by now a mature standard, fully (or
almost fully) implemented by most important compilers, highly
portable, and capable of producing highly optimized code.

In the reminder of this Wiki I will describe the main features of the
library, “in a nutshell" fashion, via a series of simple examples. I
assume that the reader is familiar with the basic concepts of quantum
mechanics/quantum information, as I do not provide any introduction to
this field. For a comprehensive introduction to the latter see e.g.
[M. Nielsen's and I. Chuang's Quantum computation and quantum information](https://www.amazon.ca/Quantum-Computation-Information-10th-Anniversary/dp/1107002176/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1516125709&sr=8-1&keywords=quantum+computation+and+quantum+information) 
excellent reference. This Wiki is not intended to be
a comprehensive documentation, but only a brief introduction to the
library and its main features. For a detailed reference see the [official
API documentation](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp/blob/master/doc/refman.pdf). 
For detailed installation instructions as well as for additional information
regarding the library see the [main repository page](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp/blob/master/).

## Building instructions for the truly impatient

If you really cannot wait anymore, continue reading the remaining. If you afford to be a bit patient, 
please skip the reminder of this section and read the detailed 
[Building instructions for POSIX-compliant systems](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp/wiki/2.-Building-instructions-for-POSIX-compliant-platforms) 
or [Building instructions for Windows](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp/wiki/3.-Building-instructions-for-Windows-platforms) 
in this Wiki.

### Installing and running under POSIX-compliant systems

In this section I assume that you use a POSIX-compliant system (e.g. UNIX-like).
To get started with [Quantum++](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp), first
install the [Eigen 3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) library into your home directory, 
as `$HOME/eigen`. You can change the name of the directory, but in the
current document I will use `$HOME/eigen` as the location of the
[Eigen 3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) library. Next, download or clone
[Quantum++](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp) library into the home
directory as `$HOME/qpp`. Finally, make sure that your compiler supports
C++11 and preferably [OpenMP](http://openmp.org/). As a compiler I
recommend [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/) version 5.0 or later or
[clang++](http://clang.llvm.org) version 3.7 or later (previous versions
of [clang++](http://clang.llvm.org) do not support
[OpenMP](http://openmp.org/)). You are now ready to go!

Next, we will build a simple minimal example to test that the installation was
successful. Create a directory called `$HOME/testing`, and inside it
create the file `minimal.cpp`, available for download in 
[`examples/minimal.cpp`](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp/blob/master/examples/minimal.cpp) and with 
the content listed below.

```CPP
// Minimal example
// Source: ./examples/minimal.cpp
#include <iostream>

#include "qpp.h"

int main() {
    using namespace qpp;
    std::cout << "Hello Quantum++!\nThis is the |0> state:\n";
    std::cout << disp(st.z0) << '\n';
}
```

Next, compile the file using the C++11 compliant compiler. In the
following I assume you use [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/), but the building
instructions are similar for other compilers. From the directory
`$HOME/testing` type

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -isystem $HOME/eigen -I $HOME/qpp/include minimal.cpp -o minimal
```

Your compile command may differ from the above, depending on the C++
compiler and operating system. If everything went fine, the above
command should build an executable `minimal` in `$HOME/testing`, which
can be run by typing `./minimal`. The output should be similar to the
following:

```
Hello Quantum++!
This is the |0> state:
1
0
````

The line

```CPP
#include "qpp.h"
```

includes the main header file of the
library `qpp.h` This header file includes all other necessary internal
[Quantum++](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp) header files. The line
```CPP
using namespace qpp;
```
injects the [Quantum++](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp)'s namespace into
the working namespace, so we don't need to prefix the library functions by
`qpp::`. Finally the line 

```CPP
std::cout << disp(st.z0) << '\n';
```

displays the state |0> represented by the Singleton `qpp::st.z0` in a
nice format using the display manipulator `qpp::disp()`.
