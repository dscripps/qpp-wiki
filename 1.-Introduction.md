[Quantum++](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp) is a C++11 general purpose quantum
computing library, composed solely of header files. It uses the
[Eigen 3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) linear algebra library and, if
available, the [OpenMP](http://openmp.org/) multi-processing library.

The simulator defines a large collection of (template) quantum computing
related functions and a few useful classes. The main data types are
complex vectors and complex matrices, which I will describe below. Most
functions operate on such vectors/matrices and *always* return the
result by value. Collection of objects are implemented via the standard
library container [`std::vector<>`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector), 
instantiated accordingly.

Although there are many available quantum computing libraries/simulators
written in various programming languages, see e.g.
[List of quantum computing simulators](http://www.quantiki.org/wiki/List_of_QC_simulators) 
for a comprehensive list, I hope what makes
[Quantum++](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp) different is the ease of
use, portability and high performance. The library is not restricted to
specific quantum information tasks, but it is intended to be
multi-purpose and capable of simulating arbitrary quantum processes. I
have chosen the C++ programming language (standard C++11) in
implementing the library as it is by now a mature standard, fully (or
almost fully) implemented by most important compilers, and highly
portable.

In the reminder of this document I will describe the main features of the
library, “in a nutshell" fashion, via a series of simple examples. I
assume that the reader is familiar with the basic concepts of quantum
mechanics/quantum information, as I do not provide any introduction to
this field. For a comprehensive introduction to the latter see e.g.
[M. Nielsen's and I. Chuang's Quantum computation and quantum information](https://www.amazon.ca/Quantum-Computation-Information-10th-Anniversary/dp/1107002176/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1516125709&sr=8-1&keywords=quantum+computation+and+quantum+information) 
excellent reference. This document is not intended to be
a comprehensive documentation, but only a brief introduction to the
library and its main features. For a detailed reference see the [official
API documentation](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp/blob/master/doc/refman.pdf). 
For detailed installation instructions as well as for additional information
regarding the library see the [main repository page](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp/blob/master/).
