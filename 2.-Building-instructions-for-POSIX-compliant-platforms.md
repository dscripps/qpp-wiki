## Pre-requisites

- Recommended compiler: [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/) version 5.0 or later
(for good C++11 support). You may also use [clang++](http://clang.llvm.org/) version 3.8 or later, please read the "Additional remarks/Building with [clang++](http://clang.llvm.org/)" subsection near the end of this document for more plarform-dependent details.
- [Eigen 3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) linear algebra library. I assume here that 
the library is installed in `$HOME/eigen`, although the location may vary, e.g. if 
the libary was installed using a package manager.
- [Quantum++](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp) library located in `$HOME/qpp`.

## Optional

- [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) version 3.0 or later, highly recommended
- [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) compiler include header 
files:
`/Applications/MATLAB_R2017b.app/extern/include`
- [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) compiler shared library 
files:
`/Applications/MATLAB_R2017b.app/bin/maci64`

## Building using [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) (version 3.0 or later)

The current version of the repository has a 
[`CMakeLists.txt`](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt)
configuration file for building examples using [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/). 
To build an example using [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/), 
I recommend an out-of-source build, i.e., from the root of the project 
(where the `include` folder is located), type

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

The commands above build the release version (default) executable `qpp`, 
from the source file `examples/minimal.cpp`,
without [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) support (default), 
inside the directory `build`. 

If the location of [Eigen 3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) is not detected
automatically by the [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) build script, 
then the build script will fail (with an error message). In this case 
the location of [Eigen 3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) needs to be specified
manually in the [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) build command line by passing
the `-DEIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR=path_to_eigen3` flag, e.g.

```bash
cmake -DEIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/eigen3 ..
```

To build a different configuration, 
e.g. the debug version with [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/)
support, type from the root of the project

```bash
cd build
rm -rf *
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DWITH_MATLAB="/Applications/MATLAB_R2017b.app" ..
make
```
    
Or, to disable [OpenMP](http://openmp.org/) support (enabled by default), type
   
```bash
cd build
rm -rf *
cmake -DWITH_OPENMP=OFF ..
make
```

To change the name of the example file or the location of 
[MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) installation, 
edit the [`CMakeLists.txt`](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt) file. Inspect also [`CMakeLists.txt`](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt) 
for additional fine-tuning options. Do not forget to clean the `build` 
directory before a fresh build!

## Building without an automatic build system

- Example file: `$HOME/qpp/examples/minimal.cpp`
- Output executable: `$HOME/qpp/examples/minimal`
- You must run the commands below from inside the directory 
`$HOME/qpp/examples` 

### Release version (without [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) support) 

```bash
g++ -pedantic -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -Weffc++ -fopenmp \
    -O3 -DNDEBUG -DEIGEN_NO_DEBUG \
    -isystem $HOME/eigen -I $HOME/qpp/include \
     minimal.cpp -o minimal
```

### Debug version (without [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) support)

```bash
g++ -pedantic -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -Weffc++ -fopenmp \
    -g3 -DDEBUG \
    -isystem $HOME/eigen -I $HOME/qpp/include \
     minimal.cpp -o minimal
```

### Release version (with [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) support)

```bash
g++ -pedantic -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -Weffc++ -fopenmp \
    -O3 -DNDEBUG -DEIGEN_NO_DEBUG \
    -isystem $HOME/eigen -I $HOME/qpp/include \
    -I/Applications/MATLAB_R2017b.app/extern/include \
    -L/Applications/MATLAB_R2017b.app/bin/maci64 \
    -lmx -lmat minimal.cpp -o minimal
```

### Debug version (with [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) support)

```bash
g++ -pedantic -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -Weffc++ -fopenmp \
    -g3 -DDEBUG \
    -isystem $HOME/eigen -I $HOME/qpp/include \
    -I /Applications/MATLAB_R2017b.app/extern/include \
    -L /Applications/MATLAB_R2017b.app/bin/maci64 \
    -lmx -lmat minimal.cpp -o minimal
```

## Additional remarks

### Building with [clang++](http://clang.llvm.org/)
- Make sure to use [clang++](http://clang.llvm.org/) version 3.8 or later (previous versions lack or do not have good [OpenMP](http://openmp.org/) support).

#### Linux specific instructions
- On Linux, you can install [clang++](http://clang.llvm.org/) version 3.8 or later via the package manager, e.g. in Debian 9 or Ubuntu 16.10 use

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install clang-3.8
    ```

- In case you get any compiler or linker errors when 
[OpenMP](http://openmp.org/) is enabled, you need to install the `libomp-dev` package, e.g in Debian 9 or Ubuntu 16.10 use

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install libomp-dev
    ```

#### [OS X/macOS](http://www.apple.com/osx) specific instructions

- I highly recommend to install [clang++](http://clang.llvm.org/) version 3.8 or later via [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/). 
- In case you get any compiler or linker errors when [OpenMP](http://openmp.org/) is enabled, you need to install the `libomp` package, e.g using [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/)

    ```bash
    sudo port install libomp
    ```

- If you enable
[MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) support, make sure that 
the environment variable `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` is set to point to the 
[MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) 
compiler shared libraries location, such as 

    ```bash
    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:"Applications/MATLAB_R2017b.app/bin/maci64"
    ```

    Otherwise, you get a runtime error similar to  

    > dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libmat.dylib.
    
    
    You can use the 
[`run_mac_MATLAB.sh`](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp/blob/master/run_mac_MATLAB.sh)
script to wrap the output executable you want to run in, as otherwise setting the `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` globally may interfere with 
[MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/)' [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) 
installation (in case you use [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) from 
[MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/)). If you use the script, 
then the environment variable is local to the script and 
does not interfere with the rest of the system. Usage example:

    ```bash
    bash ./run_mac_MATLAB.sh ./build/qpp
    ```

### Building debug versions with [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/) on [OS X/macOS](http://www.apple.com/osx)

- If you build a debug version with [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/) and use 
[gdb](http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) to step inside template functions 
you may want to add `-fno-weak` compiler flag. See 
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23330641/gnu-gdb-can-not-step-into-template-functions-os-x-mavericks>
for more details about this problem.
